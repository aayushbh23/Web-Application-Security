“Web application security” refers to the practices, tools, and principles used to protect web apps and their data from attacks, unauthorized access, and misuse.
Here’s a clear breakdown:

1. Key Principles of Web Application Security
Confidentiality – Keep sensitive data (like passwords or customer details) private.
Integrity – Ensure data isn’t altered or corrupted by unauthorized users.
Availability – Make sure the application stays accessible and functional for legitimate users.
Authentication – Verify who the user is.
Authorization – Control what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
Non-repudiation – Users can’t deny their actions (e.g., transactions).

2. Common Web Application Security Threats
SQL Injection (SQLi) – Attackers insert malicious SQL code to manipulate a database.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Injecting malicious JavaScript to steal cookies or hijack sessions.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) – Tricks a user’s browser into executing unwanted actions.
Broken Authentication – Poorly implemented login/session handling allows account hijacking.
Sensitive Data Exposure – Storing or transmitting data without encryption.
Security Misconfiguration – Leaving default passwords, open ports, or debug modes enabled.
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) – Exposing internal resources through predictable URLs.
Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) – Overloading servers to make apps unavailable.
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – Making the server send unauthorized internal requests.
Remote Code Execution (RCE) – Attacker runs arbitrary code on the server.

3. Security Best Practices
Input Validation & Output Encoding – Validate all input; escape output to prevent XSS/SQLi.
Use HTTPS (TLS) – Encrypt communication between client and server.
Strong Authentication & Authorization – Implement MFA, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
Secure Session Management – Use secure cookies, session timeouts, and regenerate session IDs.
Least Privilege Principle – Give users and services the minimum access needed.
Regular Security Updates – Patch frameworks, libraries, and dependencies.
Implement Security Headers – Use headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.
Proper Error Handling & Logging – Avoid revealing sensitive details in error messages.
Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning – Regularly test for weaknesses.
Backup & Incident Response Plans – Prepare for data recovery and breaches.

4. OWASP Top 10 (Most Recognized Standard)
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) publishes the Top 10 list of critical web security risks:
Broken Access Control
Cryptographic Failures
Injection
Insecure Design
Security Misconfiguration
Vulnerable & Outdated Components
Identification & Authentication Failures
Software & Data Integrity Failures
Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

5. Security Tools & Frameworks
Scanning Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nikto, Nessus
Code Analysis: SonarQube, Snyk, GitHub Dependabot
Authentication: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT
Web Frameworks with Security Built-In: Spring Security, ASP.NET Identity, Django Auth
